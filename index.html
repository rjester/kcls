            <p>
                In 1917 W.K. Charles Sr. (1893 -1971) began the practice of law in McCormick, South Carolina where
he built his reputation suing the railroads. William K, Charles, Jr. joined the firm in 1949 and William 
Kimbrough. Charles, III joined the practice in 1974. When Kim joined the firm in 1974 the name of the 
firm was Charles & Charles Attorneys and Counsellors at Law. In the late 70's the name was changed 
to Charles, Charles & Scurry to reflect John C. Scurry Jr becoming a partner. William K. Charles, Jr. 
left the firm in 1984 to become a South Carolina Family Court Judge. John Scurry left the firm in the 
late 80's. The firm has always been considered as a general practice firm, concentrating in Criminal 
Defense, Family Law, Commercial Law, Real Estate and Estates and Trusts. The firm is now known 
as KIM CHARLES, LEGAL SERVICES. The firm remains a general practice but concentrates on 
Criminal and Family Law cases.
